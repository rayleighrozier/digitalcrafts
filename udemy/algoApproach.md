# BEFORE YOU START CODING:

## 1. Ask the interviewer, “Can I restate the problem in my own words?”

- Make sure that you fully understand what is being asked
- What are the inputs that go into the problem?
- What are the outputs to the solution and what should they look like?
- Do the inputs give me enough information to get the desired output?
- How should I label the important pieces of data?

## 2. Write down two or three simple examples

- Ex. “If the input is [1,2,3] , it should return [3,2,1]”
- Progress to more complicated examples, edge cases, and empty/invalid inputs

## 3. Break it down

- Explicitly write out the steps you need to take
- Ex. write the shell of a function, then add a comment for each process that needs to happen

```
    function charCount(str) {
    //make object to return at end
    //loop over string for each character…
    // if char is already a key in object, increase count
    // if char is not in object, make a new key with count = 1
    // if char is invalid (spaces, punctuation etc.), don’t do anything
    //return at end }
```

# 4. TIME TO CODE:

## Solve or simplify

- If you can’t solve the whole problem, solve a simpler problem
- If you need to, ignore the difficult part and solve the parts you can first

## 5. Look back and refactor
