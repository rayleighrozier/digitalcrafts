// Steps to create a Node Server

//1. cd into your folder and do " npm init ". Or "npm init -y" to skip through all the okays.
//This sets up a folder called  "package.json".
// "package.json" is used to track the packages you'll be installing for that project.

// 2. "npm install " or "npm i" to get your tools >> you will definitely need "express"
//creates a package-lock.json and a folder called "node_modules"
//you pretty much never bother these
