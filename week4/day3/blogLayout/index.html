        <h2>Tiny Dancer</h2>
        <p>
          Blue-jean baby L.A. lady Seamstress for the band Pretty-eyed Pirate
          smile You'll marry a music man Ballerina You must've seen her Dancing
          in the sand And now she's in me Always with me Tiny dancer in my hand
          Jesus freaks Out in the street Handing tickets out for God Turning
          back She just laughs The boulevard is not that bad Piano man He makes
          his stand In the auditorium Looking on She sings the songs The words
          she knows The tune she hums But oh, how it feels so real Lying here,
          with no one near Only you and you can hear me When I say softly,
          slowly Hold me closer, tiny dancer Count the headlights on the highway
          Lay me down in sheets of linen You had a busy day today
