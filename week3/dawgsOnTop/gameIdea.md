Scoring ->

- Roll a random score from your team's offense range
  # minimum = (0) (per half)
        # Every experience point boost your minimum by 3 (ex. from 0 to 7)
  # maximum = (51) (per half) (base # is 7) (max offense points = 170 <--cap here)
        # Every 10 offense points boost your maximum by 3 (ex. from 14 to 21)
  # tiniest range for Game 1 1st half = (3-7) (offense =0, exp =1 defense coach + run drills + stetson)
  # largest range for Game 1 1st half = (0-15) (offense = 55, exp =0 )
- Rival's defense has a chance to subtract from your score
  # Every 10 defense points = 1 chance to roll/detract points
  # Every experience point improves your odds during a roll
- Do this twice for each team (first half/second half) to get final score
- If you score is bigger than your rival's score you win
