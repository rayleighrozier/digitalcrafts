# Overview

Music Mood Ring is a web application that gives song recommendations based on a user's mood and genre of choice. Users can listen to the song, and store it in their collection if they choose.

## How It Works

Once the mood ring is launched, the user is asked to select their mood and music genre of choice.
The application uses those inputs to select an ID from a library of playlists created by Spotify users. It then calls the API using the ID, and returns a random song from the selected playlist.

## Technologies

This application was built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It uses Spotify's API to access song data.

## How To Use

To use Music Mood Ring, you will need a [Client ID and Client Secret from Spotify] (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/app-settings/). This application is currently not being hosted, but can be run locally on your computer.
